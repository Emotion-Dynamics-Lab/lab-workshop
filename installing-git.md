# Installing Git

It's possible, particularly if you are using a Windows computer, that Git may not be installed. If this is the case, Git can be manually installed.

## Windows
Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

## macOS
1. Open Terminal.app (press command-space and begin typing Terminal. Select Terminal to launch it)
2. Copy and paste the following into the terminal window: `xcode-select --install` and press Enter. A small installer window will appear. 
3. Follow the directions to install Git, which may take some time.
