## Branch and Pull Request workfklow
### Part 1
* In GitHub Desktop create a new branch `name/rec-review`.
* Make sure you're on your new branch!
* Publish the branch. 
* Open the `.Rmd` of the person whose name is next in the alphabet to your own.
* Write "I have seen it!" or "I haven't seen it!" below their recommendation. 
* In GitHub Desktop: commit (don't forget a description!) and push. 
* (try switching between branches right now and see how the `.Rmd` file changes!)

### Part 2
* On GitHub.com create a Pull Request
* Review changes to ensure you're merging in what you want. 
* You may have to get approval to merge your changes.
* Approvers and others can comment on specific lines of code.
* Merge!
