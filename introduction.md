### What is git? 
Git is a version control system. Although there are other VCSs out there, Git is by far the most popular and easiest to use. 

Git **repositories** (or "repos") are collections of related files, such as files related to a single project. You can think of a repo as being synonymous with a project. Files for different projects should live in their own repository. 

Git can be used entirely locally on your own computer, or in conjunction with a cloud provider (like GitHub!). It can be helpful whether you are working on a project entirely on your own, or when collaborating with others.

### What is a Version Control System? 
A version control system (VCS) manages and tracks changes to files, creates an immutable history, and assists with avoiding or reconciling conflicts. 

Unlike manually saving different versions of a file, VCSs can easily track the history of a huge number of files in a systematic way. This helps reduce the likelihood of data loss, maintains a clear version history, and facilitates comparing any two versions of a file or files at any point in history. 

If you've ever regretted a change you made to a paper and wished you could get that old version back, you were wishing for a VCS like Git. 

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud service that allows you to store Git repositories in the cloud. This makes collaboration easy, provides you with redundancy if your computer is damaged or lost, and adds a lot of handy features.
