## What if I want to learn more?
If you want to learn more about Git, here are a few resources for you:
* [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) is an introduction and tutorial from GitHub, walking you through the very basics of the platform. 
* [Pro Git eBook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a free resource and is _the_ canonical resource for all things git. It is an exceptoinally dense, dry, and technical read. 


## FAQ
* **Does R Studio have built in Git support?**
  * R Studio does indeed! It is only available if you use R Studio Projects. If you do not use Projects, you have to use Git from the Github desktop application or the terminal.
